## Lab Overview

In this lab, we'll practice using javascript objects by exploring the world of Jurassic Park!

## Getting Started

- Fork and Clone this repository
- Open in VSCode
- Create a new file called `js-objects-practice.js`. You'll do all your work in this file. Remember, you can test your work by typing `node js-objects-practice.js` in the terminal.

## Lab Instructions

### Movie Database (quick warmup)

Create your own JavaScript object representing your favorite movie.

> Example:

> ```javascript
> const blade = {
>   title: 'Blade',
>   director: 'Stephen Norrington',
>   actors: ['Wesley Snipes', 'Stephen Dorff', 'Kris Kristofferson'],
>   releaseYear: 1998,
>   duration: 120
> }
> ```

1. After you have created your movie object, console log the title of your movie using `dot notation`
2. Console log the director's name
3. Console log the release year
4. Maybe your favorite movie came with an extended director's cut - write a statement that increases your movie object's duration by 25 minutes

### Hammonds Mines

Today we visit Jurassic Park to explore the wild world of objects! You have been brought on to manage the dig sites for Dr. John Hammond. Spared no expense, so let's get to work!

Copy and paste each of the JavaScript snippets into your JavaScript file.

#### Part 1

```javascript
const snakewaterMontana = {
  paleontologist: 'Dr. Alan Grant',
  depth: '10 meters',
  specimen: 'Velociraptor'
}
```

1. Create a variable called `guestOfHonor` and assign its value to the name of the paleontologist in `snakewaterMontana`.

2. Access the value of the specimen key found in the `snakewaterMontana` object and store it in a variable called `cleverGirl`.

#### Part 2

```javascript
const nicaragua = {
  depth: '200 meters',
  annualBudget: 1500000,
  specimens: [
    'Tyrannosaurus Rex',
    'Stegosaurous',
    'Triceratops',
    'Velociraptor'
  ]
}
```

1. Store the array of specimens of this site into a variable called `nicaraguanSpecimens`.

2. Make a variable called `favoriteSpecimen` and assign its value to your favorite dinosaur within `nicaraguanSpecimens` ( can you do this by referencing the `nicaragua` object itself? )

3. Add 250000 to the annual budget of this site.

#### Part 3

```javascript
const hammondsMines = {
  buenos_aires: {
    depth: '400 meters',
    annualBudget: 1000000,
    specimens: ['Dilophosaurus', 'Brachiosaurus']
  },
  mexico: {
    depth: '350 meters',
    annualBudget: 900000,
    specimens: ['Gallimimus', 'Parasaurolophus']
  }
}
```

1. Access the depth of John Hammond's mine in Mexico, store the depth of the Mexican mine into an appropriately named variable.

2. Access the annual budget for Hammond's mine in Buenos Airies, store the annual budget in a variable.

3. Access and console the dinosaur DNA specimens found in Buenos Aires.

4. Insert Nicaragua into `hammondsMines`.

5. Create three variables to store the annual budgets for each mine into them.

6. Create a new reasonably named variable to track the total annual cost of operation for the mines by adding the previously stored budgets.

7. Access and console log the "Parasaurolophus" specimen.
